# Headless Chrome

## What I Want To Test

* Try out Headless Chrome since [https://robots.thoughtbot.com/headless-feature-specs-with-chrome](since Thoughtbot did an article about it). [https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist/issues/882](Been following the news around it as well).
* いろんなことを試してみよう

## Todo

- [ ] Run Capybara with headless chrome. See if you can get it to actually run headless instead with launching another window instance
